README

This application is designed to track a persons emotional state over an
extended period of time. The idea behind it is for the user to identify
key areas in their lives where their depression or anxiety is higher that
normal. Through this the hope is that they will be able to identify unexpected
things that trigger this increase and work with a professional to get through
them.

The full implementation will include:
1. a suicide hotline if the user selects "extremely depressed" as their status.
2. a messanger system with emergency contacts and the ability for one of the
contacts to signal to the others that they are responding.
3. A graph of the users emotional state.
4. A 'Did you take your meds?' prompt

Potential features:
1. A diary feature that flags key words during times or extreme anxiety/depression.
2. The optional ability for the user to allow the medical professional treating them
to access certain parts of their data. The graph of their emotial state, key words,
and whether they took their meds.
