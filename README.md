This application is designed to track a persons emotional state over an
extended period of time. The idea behind it is for the user to identify
key areas in their lives where their depression or anxiety is higher that
normal. Through this the hope is that they will be able to identify unexpected
things that trigger this increase and work with a professional to get through
them.
